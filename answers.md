1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

	The describe gloabl sets up a test that can encompass multipls it operations. They provide a good way to structure your tests so that related tests can all be housed in the same describe function.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

	Test-Driven Development allows for a higher percentage of test-coverage, becasue you write the tests code first. I think this is a good approach, I mean having a higher test coverage percentage is obvioulsy ideal, but it is also a harder way to think about creating code. Maybe becasue it seems backwards, but I think that refactoring my thinknig on how the process should go--test first, code second--although not easy, will help me become a stronger dev in the end.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

	Unit tests, component tests, and snapshot tests.
